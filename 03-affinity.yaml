# üèó Tolerations vs. Affinit

#   - Tolerations allow pods to be scheduled on nodes with taints. They don't force the pod onto a specific node, but rather ensure it‚Äôs not rejected by nodes with matching taints.
# - Affinity (Node Affinity & Pod Affinity) actively influences where a pod should be scheduled based on specific rules.
# üîç Why Do We Need Affinity When Tolerations Exist?
# - Tolerations Prevent Rejection, But Don't Choose Nodes
# - Tolerations allow a pod to be scheduled on tainted nodes, but Kubernetes may still place the pod elsewhere.
# - If you need a pod to be placed on a specific set of nodes, Affinity helps enforce that.
